                        i have not lived on this earth for very long, 25 years to be precise, but i can say with absolute certainty 
                        that every person i have met so far has had their fair share of challenges and struggles. 
                        it's no secret that life is challenging for everybody, and because of these struggles, it's easy
                        to forget just how lucky we are to even be alive. our very existence can be boiled down to a myriad of events
                        that brought about other sequences of events which eventually led up to now, the present moment. 
                        really take that in for a second! as of right now, you are able to take a deep breath and realize 
                        that you are a product of every event that has ever happened in our mysterious universe. you and i are a part of this
                        entire thing. that makes us really special! this reality would not be the same if you did not exist in it. that is how 
                        special your existence is. think about that - the very nature of this reality is entirely dependent on whether you exist in it or not!

                        i've always been existential, even as a kid. i was so religious that as a 9-year-old, i would walk to church by myself
                        to attend sunday mass. i think it stems from the fact that i haven't really had it easy, even back then. 
                        whenever i experienced deep sadness, i would ask god why i was alive. the voice in my head would always tell me that 
                        i am here because he wants me to experience life. i'm not really about religion anymore. i'm not even sure i believe in the
                        abrahamic god. as i got older, i realize that the church has so much potential for good things. with the money they have, they can change 
                        lives of millions, even billions of people. i realize now that they care more about building beautiful churches to serve god than to help
                        those who are in need. why would a loving god allow cold, greedy men to have so much power?

                        as a kid in the philippines, i have a vivid memory of seeings other kids going around the neighborhood
                        in their beat-up pedicabs, going through garbages to look for food. what made me so special that i had it better than them? 
                        what did i do to deserve a better life? what did they do to deserve such a shitty quality of life? and so as i grew older, i started to realize that
                        the existence of a loving god simply did not make sense. i started to realize that the belief that gave me so much comfort had been wrong all this time.

                        i started looking for the meaning of life. for a couple of years, my grades plummeted along with my mental health. it kept me up at night. eventually, i found out about buddhism, and stoicism. 
                        i found admiration for these beliefs because they were realistic - life is full of suffering! i realized that this is the reason why it's so important
                        to be kind to others. i realized what people really meant when they say "you don't know what the person beside you is going through".
                        this realization made me realize how selfish i had been living. i felt as if a veil has been lifted off and i'm seeing life as it really is for the first time. 
                        my depression has blinded me for so long. it had never fully occurred to me that other people are going through shit too. i'm not alone in this.

                    <p>
                        that's when i started to be thankful for every good thing that i've been blessed with in this life. this whole time, i've had such a loving, caring partner
                        who has stayed by my side and supported me through my lowest lows. i've been blessed with good friends who have stayed loyal no matter the distance in both temporal and spacial.
                        gratitude made me realize how shitty of a son, brother, and friend i had been all this time. it's helped me realize that a huge reason i'm so depressed is because 
                        i would wallow in my sadness instead of focusing on all the good things that has ever happened to me. gratitude has made me realize that my existence is important, because now, i have to
                        become the best version of myself so that i can lift up the people around me.

                        i realize now that there is no universal meaning to life. we are the ones who have to decide what meaning we give it. :)
