                        <span>the many worlds hypothesis has been on my mind a lot lately.
                            <br>it doesn't help that it's basically the underlying plot of many different science fiction stories out right now -- 
                            rick and morty, the MCU, even that new movie called <i>everything everywhere all at once</i>.
                            <br><br>
                            erwin schrodinger proposed a hypothesis which states that if you were to place a cat in a box and seal it alongside something
                            that could kill the cat (curiosity hehe), it would be impossible to know if the cat survived or died until you open the box. therefore,
                            according to erwin, prior to opening the box, the cat is in a state called <i>superposition</i> - dead and alive at the same time. the reality
                            is only actualized once the box has been opened. 
                            <br><br>
                            this idea shares a few parallels with aristotle's potentiality and actuality. according to aristotle, everything in our reality is a direct result of a cause and
                            effect cycle that has been going on since the beginning of time. he says that a <i>something</i> is caused by another <i>something</i>, and that <i>something</i>
                            was actualized by <i>something else</i>. it's like when a caterpillar goes through metamorphosis and becomes a butterfly. the butterfly is potential <i>actualized</i>. 
                            we see this everywhere in nature - time healing a wound, plane taking off from saskatoon and landing somewhere with nicer weather, will smith walking up to chris rock and slapping
                            the shit out of him. 
                            <br><br>
                            pre-actualization, there are multiple scenarios that could have happened instead. will smith could have tripped and laughed out of the oscar's, the flight from saskatoon could be cancelled,
                            the caterpillar could have been eaten by a bird. these are all logical scenarios, which means that in a parallel world, things would turn out differently. if you really think about it,
                            evolution came to be because a common ancestor of all living beings on earth were exposed to different circumstances, and were forced to adapt accordingly. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/07/05/127937070/the-human-edge-finding-our-inner-fish" target="_blank"><b>it's true! here's an example</b></a>
                            <br><br>
                            if the number of potential events that can be actualized is damn near infinite, does this mean that our reality is not entirely deterministic? in other words,
                            the existence of parallel realities where we made different decisions would be proof that there is such a thing as free will
                            <br><br>
                            wouldn't this come to mean that the version of us that we strive to be <i>(our higher self if you will)</i>, is already half alive, waiting to be actualized?
                            <br><br>
                            i guess to summarize my philosophical jargon - there is a reality out there where we are living our best lives despite life's best attempt to throw challenges at us. 
                            <br><br>
                            <i>if the best version of me already exists in a parallel universe, what is stopping me from actualizing that same reality?</i>
